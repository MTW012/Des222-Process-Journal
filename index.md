### what is agitation
Agitation is a feeling of irritability, mental distress or severe restlessness. It may feel like inner tension. And it often involves involuntary (out of your control) behaviors that serve no clear purpose, like fidgeting. Agitation can range from mild to severe and can develop rapidly or slowly. It can be brief or long-lasting.

Agitation can develop from a wide range of medical conditions. But brief, mild episodes of agitation are also a normal part of being human. Stressful or frustrating situations can make you feel agitated.

You may be wondering: How do I know if agitation is a medical problem? There’s not a clear answer. But if agitation is interfering with your day-to-day life, relationships or work, you should see a healthcare provider for help. If agitation escalates to aggression, suicidal behaviors or violence, you should seek immediate medical help.

Researchers don’t know the exact cause of agitation. But they think it involves an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters (chemical messengers), like dopamine, serotonin and others.

#### Agitation and Dementia: Prevention and Treatment Strategies in Acute and Chronic Conditions
As indicated by a recent meta-analysis (75), music intervention, especially when employed in groups, can significantly reduce agitation in cognitively impaired patients. Furthermore, passive listening to music has been associated with behavioral improvement and reduction of aggressiveness and agitation (76). This effect is considered to be driven by a positive exploration of repressed feelings (76).

Regarding music therapy trials, some studies have explored the effectiveness of white noise to prevent the sundowning syndrome, or the use of personalized music, via headphones, upon daily hygiene care or walking, reporting that these approaches can improve agitated behavior.
